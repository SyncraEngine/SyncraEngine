Security & Privacy in SyncraEngine
====================================

SyncraEngine aims to be both **open and extensible** while protecting user data
and mitigating malicious or buggy code. Its approach relies on process isolation,
permission-based ECS access, selective data retention, and optional encryption.
This document provides an overview of how these features combine to secure both
offline and social VR experiences.

Key Security Principles
----------------------

1. **Process Isolation**
   Each driver (renderer, audio, networking, etc.) operates as a separate
   subprocess, overseen by :doc:`../architecture/runtime`. If a driver
   crashes or becomes compromised, it cannot directly affect the rest of
   the system. The runtime can automatically restart or quarantine the
   problematic subprocess.

2. **Permissioned ECS**
   The ECS (:doc:`../architecture/engine_ecs`) enforces read/write sets for
   scripts and driver interactions. A script or driver that attempts to
   access data outside its declared permissions is blocked. This prevents
   unauthorized or accidental modifications to components.

3. **Minimal Data Retention**
   Logs, user information, or ephemeral world states are retained only as
   long as necessary. This reduces the impact of potential breaches and
   respects user preferences for privacy.

4. **Encryption & Authentication**
   Network traffic can be encrypted (e.g., via TLS) to deter eavesdropping.
   Future enhancements may include user authentication tokens or role-based
   session management for more advanced security requirements.

Process-Based Sandbox
---------------------

**Rationale**: Traditional engines running everything in a single process are
vulnerable to exploitation in one subsystem (e.g., rendering or networking)
that can jeopardize the entire platform. SyncraEngine, however, uses separate
drivers in distinct processes, each with:

- **Limited Privileges**
  The operating system can restrict file/device access and networking to only
  what each driver explicitly requires.
- **IPC Boundaries**
  Drivers interact with the engine through dataflow channels or shared memory,
  subject to strict read/write controls. They cannot freely access the engine’s
  memory space.

**Outcome**: Compromising one driver does not grant access to the ECS memory
or other drivers, greatly reducing the risk of system-wide failure.

Permissions & the ECS
---------------------

Within the engine:

- **Read/Write Sets**
  Scripts or driver nodes declare the components or resources they need to
  read or write. If a script tries to read a “UserProfile” component without
  permission, the engine blocks that request.
- **Dependency Declarations**
  Systems can specify prerequisites (e.g., “I must run after SystemA”), enabling
  the ECS to schedule them in parallel while still denying unauthorized data
  access.

By pairing concurrency controls with permission sets, SyncraEngine prevents
scripts from interfering with or spying on data they are not authorized to see.

Network Encryption
------------------

For multi-user scenarios:

- **TLS**
  SyncraEngine can employ standard TLS or comparable encryption for
  client-server communication, safeguarding positional updates, voice chat
  streams, or script events from eavesdropping or MITM attacks.
- **Optional End-to-End**
  Certain use cases or communities may require end-to-end encryption
  (E2EE) for voice or chat, ensuring even the central server cannot see
  unencrypted payloads. While more complex to implement across various
  drivers, it remains a possible extension.

Data Retention & Privacy
------------------------

1. **Ephemeral Data**
   By default, logs or transient session data (e.g., chat messages,
   debug output) are stored only in memory or for brief periods on disk.
   This policy helps maintain privacy and reduces the scope of potential
   breaches.

2. **User Profiles**
   If a user profile system is used, only minimal data (e.g., display name,
   avatar reference) may be stored. Sensitive information (email, billing)
   can be managed through :doc:`cloud_integration` or a third-party
   authentication provider.

3. **Logs**
   SyncraRuntime and drivers typically keep rolling logs that discard old
   data after a set time or size threshold. This retains enough diagnostic
   data without permanently logging user activity.

Malicious Scripts & Audits
--------------------------

Even with isolation, adversaries may attempt to manipulate the game state or
send malicious packets:

- **Script Validation**
  The engine can reject or flag scripts requesting blacklisted functions or
  excessive permissions for critical components.
- **Source Auditing**
  While the engine’s source code is available to trusted contributors,
  user-created scripts can also be inspected by the community, discouraging
  malicious code in official contexts.
- **Auto-Detection**
  If a script or driver repeatedly crashes or triggers anomalies, SyncraRuntime
  can quarantine it and alert users or server administrators.

Security Roadmap
----------------

Potential future developments:

1. **User Roles & ACLs**
   Server operators can define roles (admin, moderator, user) with distinct
   permissions for ECS or driver access.
2. **Advanced Auth**
   Deeper integration of OAuth or other identity frameworks for multi-user
   cloud sessions.
3. **Intrusion Detection**
   Hooks in the runtime to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., excessive
   script rewrites, repeated ECS overwrites from the same IP).
4. **Encrypted or Signed Packages**
   Official or user-created scripts can be delivered in a tamper-resistant
   form to ensure integrity.

Conclusion
----------

Security and privacy in SyncraEngine leverage a multi-process architecture,
permissioned ECS, ephemeral data handling, and optional encryption. This allows
innovation in VR and social experiences without compromising user trust.
