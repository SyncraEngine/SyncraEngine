Security & Privacy in SyncraEngine
====================================

SyncraEngine aims to be both **open and extensible** while protecting user data
and mitigating malicious or buggy code. This balance is achieved through process
isolation, permissioned ECS access, selective data retention, and optional
encryption. Below, we’ll explore how these features come together to secure
both offline and social VR experiences.

Key Security Principles
----------------------

1. **Process Isolation**
   Each driver (renderer, audio, networking, etc.) runs as a separate subprocess
   managed by :doc:`../architecture/runtime`. If a driver crashes or is
   compromised, it cannot directly affect the rest of the system. The runtime
   can automatically restart or quarantine it.

2. **Permissioned ECS**
   The ECS (see :doc:`../architecture/engine_ecs`) enforces read/write sets
   for scripts and driver interactions. If a script or driver tries to access
   data it hasn’t declared, the engine disallows it. This prevents unauthorized
   or accidental tampering of components.

3. **Minimal Data Retention**
   Logs, user data, or ephemeral world states are stored only as long as needed.
   This reduces the impact of potential breaches and respects user privacy
   preferences.

4. **Encryption & Authentication**
   Data traveling across the network can be encrypted (TLS or other methods) to
   prevent eavesdropping. Future expansions may include user authentication
   tokens or roles for more complex session management.

Process-Based Sandbox
---------------------

**Why**: Traditional engines may run everything in one process, letting bugs or
exploits in rendering or netcode undermine the entire system. SyncraEngine
spins up drivers in distinct processes, each having:

- **Limited Privileges**: The OS restricts file access, device access, or
  network ports unless explicitly allowed.
- **IPC Boundaries**: Communication uses dataflow channels or shared memory with
  strict read/write controls. Drivers do not freely call into engine memory.

**Result**: A compromised driver cannot trivially read or overwrite ECS memory
belonging to other drivers or the engine.

Permissions & the ECS
---------------------

Within the engine itself:

- **Read/Write Sets**: Scripts or driver nodes must declare which components or
  resources they read/write. If a script tries to read “UserProfile” components
  without permission, the engine scheduler blocks it.
- **Dependency Declarations**: Systems can say “I must run after SystemA.” The
  ECS uses these constraints to parallelize safely and deny unauthorized
  data changes.

By combining ECS concurrency with permission sets, SyncraEngine ensures that user
scripts cannot sabotage or intercept data they aren’t meant to see.

Network Encryption
------------------

For multi-user sessions:

- **TLS**: SyncraEngine typically uses standard TLS or another proven encryption
  protocol for traffic between clients and servers. This prevents basic
  eavesdropping or MITM attacks on script updates, position data, or voice chat.
- **Optional E2EE**: If demanded by users or certain community groups, we could
  implement end-to-end encryption for voice or chat, so the central server
  never sees unencrypted payloads. This can be more complex to implement
  across multiple drivers but remains a potential extension.

Data Retention & Privacy
------------------------

1. **Ephemeral Data**
   By default, logs or ephemeral session data (like chat messages, debug prints)
   are stored only in memory or for short times on disk. This helps preserve
   user privacy and reduce any forensic trail if a breach occurs.

2. **User Profiles**
   If you choose to integrate a user profile system, you can store minimal
   info (e.g., display name, avatar reference). More sensitive data (email,
   billing) can be handled via the optional :doc:`cloud_integration` or a
   separate authentication service.

3. **Logs**
   The runtime and drivers can keep short rolling logs, discarding old data
   after a certain size or time window. This approach ensures you have
   enough info to debug crashes or anomalies without hoarding user activity
   logs indefinitely.

Malicious Scripts & Audits
--------------------------

Even with sandboxing, a determined attacker might try to manipulate your
game state or spam malicious packets:

- **Script Validation**: The engine can reject or flag scripts that use
  blacklisted functions, or that declare access to critical components they
  lack permission for.
- **Source Auditing**: While the engine code is source-available to trusted
  contributors, user scripts can also be open for community inspection,
  further discouraging malicious code in official communities.
- **Auto-Detection**: If a script or driver causes repeated crashes,
  SyncraRuntime can quarantine it and alert the user or server operators.

Security Roadmap
----------------

Planned or potential expansions include:

1. **User Roles & ACLs**
   Let server owners define roles (admin, moderator, user) with different
   ECS or driver-level permissions.
2. **Advanced Auth**
   Possibly integrating OAuth or other identity frameworks for cloud or
   multi-user sessions.
3. **Intrusion Detection**
   Hooks in the runtime that detect suspicious patterns (like excessive
   script rewrites or repeated ECS component overwrites from a single IP).
4. **Encrypted or Signed Packages**
   For distributing official or user scripts, ensuring no one can tamper
   with them in transit.

Conclusion
----------

Security and privacy are baked into SyncraEngine’s multi-process design,
permissioned ECS, ephemeral data approach, and optional encryption. This
gives developers peace of mind while letting the community push VR
innovation without sacrificing user trust. If you’re interested in the
underlying concurrency model, see :doc:`../architecture/runtime` or
:doc:`../architecture/drivers`. For more advanced or optional cloud-based
privacy, check out :doc:`cloud_integration`.
